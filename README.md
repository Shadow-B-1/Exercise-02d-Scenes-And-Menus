# Project2D

Project for MSCH-C220

A basic shooting arcade game, with background and music.

## Implementation

Created using [Unity 2022.3.17f1](https://unity.com/download)

Assets are provided Unity and online pictures. The music is a free assest from Unity that I got, and the background image is an image on google.

I added music, background image, particles, 3 enemies and I have a start and end game menu.
